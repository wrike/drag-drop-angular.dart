## Drag Drop library for Dart Angular-driven apps
Designed to utilize HTML5 Drag and Drop API, it supports all major and modern browsers.

Due to nature of the underlying API, it's possible to implement system-wide drag'n'drop interactions.

It also provides ability to manage scroll-on-drag process.

Based on `drag_drop` package [GitHub](https://github.com/wrike/drag-drop.dart), [Pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/drag_drop)
